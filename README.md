Hi, I’m @JamesBunker.
I'm studying Computer Engineering at the University of Guelph.
I’m interested in working in the fields of hardware design, machine learning, and data analytics.
The current project is developing a RISC processor.
The future project is a facial recognition program accelerated by the BASYS 3 FPGA and complemented by a GPP.
